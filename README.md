Build an app using the Bike Index API. Your app could list all the bikes that have been registered as stolen in a given location in the past week.

1. We can start with a one location (zip-code) and then go on to create a method for searching for all the bikes stolen in your area in the past week or x amount of time
- knowing this we need to find and test our api endpoints in postman before utilizing in our app.

2. it could display statistics - for instance, you could see which manufacturer is most frequently stolen in a given area. 
- knowing this we need to find and test our api endpoints in postman before utilizing in our app.

3. Our app should be able to switch between different api requests and display the information in different formats.
